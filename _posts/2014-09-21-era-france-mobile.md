This Agile project involved building a mobile version of the ERA France national website, hosted on a dedicated subdomain. I worked with a small team creating user functionality and forms for individual content sections. This approach was duplicated for ERA Switzerland and ERA Germany websites.

![ERA France Mobile Website]({{ "/images/" | append: page.img_large | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url  }})

### Coolest app features
Property search option based on the user's geolocation, infinite scroll of property search results, and extensive custom form validation

### Biggest accomplishments
* Displaying properties for sale on a map in proximity to the user's location within a radius set by the user
* Restructuring content from a large and expansive ERA France website into a more intuitive and lean mobile-only site 

### Technologies used
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript/jQuery
* Ajax/JSON
* Google Maps API
* SQL/SQL Server  
* ColdFusion
* Subversion

### Note
The app was decommissioned in 2015
