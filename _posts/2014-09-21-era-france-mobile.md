This project involved building a mobile version of the ERA France national website. As an employee of ERA Europe, I worked on a small team creating user functionality and forms for individual content sections. This approach was duplicated for ERA Switzerland and ERA Germany.

### Special features
* Data search results without page refresh
* Geo-location
* Auto-completion
* Custom form validation

### Technologies:
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript/jQuery
* Ajax/JSON
* Google Maps API
* SQL/SQL Server  
* ColdFusion
