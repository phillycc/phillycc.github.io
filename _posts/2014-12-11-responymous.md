This app allows instructors of the Iron Yard to gauge the effectiveness of their lectures by aggregating and visually displaying student polling data. I created and presented the app as my capstone project while enrolled in the Iron Yard's 12-week coding bootcamp for front-end engineering.

While collaborating with a classmate, I was the Agile team lead, and focused on coding the AngularJS MVC design, instructor UI, user authentication, and populating a NoSQL database.

Responymous is currently being used for three Iron Yard bootcamps in Orlando: Front-end Engineering, Rails Engineering, and Mobile Engineering.

### Special features:
* User interfaces based on role (student vs. instructor)
* Progress bar in instructor UI moves in real-time as students vote
* Unlimited student voting, but only last vote is counted
* Student polling selections obscured from watchful eyes of fellow classmates
* Responsive design to encourage student voting on smartphone
* GitHub authentication and login

* AngularJS
* Ajax/JSON
* NoSQL/Firebase
* OAuth 2.0
* Yeoman/Gulp
* git/gitflow/GitHub
