This app represented a capstone project while I was enrolled in the Iron Yard Academyâ€™s 12-week coding bootcamp for front-end engineering. The app gauged the effectiveness of lectures by showing the instructor a visual of aggregated student polling data in real-time. Students indicted their level of comprehension to new concepts by selecting on a scale of 1 to 5. 

I was the Agile lead for a small group of classmates working on the project and focused my efforts on coding the AngularJS MVC design, instructor UI, user authentication, and designing/populating a NoSQL database.

### Coolest app features
Two separate user interfaces based on role (student and instructor), Bootstrap progress bar in instructor UI moved in real-time as students voted, and the mobile UI helped obscured student selections from the watchful eyes of fellow classmates.

### Biggest accomplishments
* GitHub authentication and login
* Getting the app completed in two weeks and presenting it to the Orlando tech community 
* The audience was invited to test the app in real-time, even though it was designed and tested for smaller target audience (i.e., Iron Yard cohorts of no more than 20 students). Did not crash despite vigorous attempts to do so. 

### Technologies used
* Bootstrap/HTML5/CSS
* AngularJS
* Ajax/JSON
* NoSQL/Firebase
* OAuth 2.0
* Yeoman/Gulp
* git/gitflow/GitHub
