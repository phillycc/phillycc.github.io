This app represented a capstone project while I was enrolled in the Iron Yard Academyâ€™s 12-week coding bootcamp for front-end engineering. The purpose of the app allowed Iron Yard instructors to gauge the effectiveness of their lectures by aggregating and visually displaying student polling data. 

Students indicted their level of comprehension to new concepts by selecting from a scale of 1 to 5 and could vote without limit. I was the Agile lead for a small group of classmates working on the project and focused my effort on coding the AngularJS MVC design, instructor UI, user authentication, and designing/populating a NoSQL database.

### Coolest app features
Two separate user interfaces based on role (student and instructor), Bootstrap progress bar in instructor UI moved in real-time as students voted, and the mobile UI helped obscured student selections from the watchful eyes of fellow classmates.

### Biggest accomplishments
* Getting the app completed in two weeks and then presenting it to the local tech community at large 
* The app was used in real-time by all in the audience who used the GitHub authentication and login to rate our presentation 
* GitHub authentication and login

### Technologies used
* Bootstrap/HTML5/CSS
* AngularJS
* Ajax/JSON
* NoSQL/Firebase
* OAuth 2.0
* Yeoman/Gulp
* git/gitflow/GitHub
