This fully responsive website provides BioPlus patients electronic access to their protected health information (PHI), including prescription history, contact info, and medical data. Patients can also conduct a series of transactions, including ordering refills, e-signing consent forms, and updating contact info.

I led this greenfield project, designing the UI/UX (via interactive Balsamiq wireframes), building the front-end, directing the API development team, and leading a cross-functional team of department heads to ensure buy-in, compliance, and testing.
