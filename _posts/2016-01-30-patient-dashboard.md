This fully responsive website provides BioPlus patients electronic access to their protected health information (PHI) on all non-wearable devices. Patients can also conduct a series of transactions, including ordering refills, e-signing consent forms, and updating contact info. I led this greenfield project, designing the UI/UX (via interactive Balsamiq wireframes), building the front-end, directing the API development team, and leading a cross-functional team of department heads to ensure buy-in and compliance.

### Coolest app features

In addition to getting their complete prescription history, patients can track their drug shipments in real-time via FedEx tracking. They can also watch detailed images and instructional videos specific to their medication.

### Biggest accomplishments

Being the driving force behind the company's first-ever patient portal on a project requiring me to wear a variety of different hats. More than 2,000 BioPlus patients have registered for online access to their medical data. Securing the website and patient health information (PHI) was a top-priority and was confirmed successfully via third-party penetration testing.
