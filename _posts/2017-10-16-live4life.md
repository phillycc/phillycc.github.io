This one-person project turned an employees-only website (built with WordPress) into a hybrid mobile app for both Android and iOS. I customized the mobile UI using [AppPresser](https://apppresser.com/)  and compiled the requisite apk (Android) and ipa (iOS) files using Adobe [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/). I released the former to the Google Play Store and built the latter for in-house distribution.

### Coolest app features
Despite building several dozen WordPress sites during my career, this was my first Intranet site built entirely with WordPress (using LDAP/Active Directory), my first e-commerce component (using WooCommerce and myCRED), and my first social site (using BuddyPress).  

### Biggest accomplishments
* Learning how to generate and export the various iOS certificates, .p12 files, and provisioning profiles (using a Mac mini) and then using Adobe PhoneGap Build to create the .ipa file.
* Migrating the site, MySQL database, and SSL certificate from Windows Server 2012 to a Microsoft Azure cloud host. Achieved a whopping 79 percent performance increase for a site that previously made users wait 18 seconds on average for a page to download. 

### Technologies used
* AppPresser Ionic mobile framework for WordPress
* Adobe PhoneGap Build
* Apple Developer Enterprise console
* Google Play Console
* Azure PaaS hosting for WordPress 
* MySQL Workbench
