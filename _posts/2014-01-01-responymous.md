This real-time instructional feedback app allows instructors of the Iron Yard to poll students' level of understanding as lecture topics are being presented. This was my capstone project as a student of the Iron Yard's 12-week coding bootcamp for front end engineering.

While collaborating with a classmate, I was team lead and focused on coding the AngularJS MVC design, instructor UI, user authentication, and populating a NoSQL database.

### Special features:
* User interfaces based on role (student vs. instructor)
* Progress bar in instructor UI moves in real-time as students vote
* Unlimited student voting, but only last vote is counted
* Student polling selections obscured from watchful eyes of fellow classmates
* Responsive design to encourage student voting on smartphone
* GitHub authentication and login
