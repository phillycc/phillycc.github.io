As an independent consultant, I created this HOA's first website in 2008. It included an online vehicle registration system that I built using Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. The system gave community residents the ability to register their cars with the association and also provided the Board an administrator's dashboard for registration fulfillment, alerts, and reporting.

In 2014, I redesigned the website using WordPress. Online vehicle registration is no longer functional, but I may resurrect it as a WordPress plugin. Otherwise, I still maintain the content of the site for a monthly fee.
