As an independent consultant, I created this HOA's first website in 2008. It included an online vehicle registration system that I built using PHP and MySQL. The system gave community residents the ability to register their cars with the association and also provided the Board an administrator's dashboard for registration fulfillment, alerts, and reporting. In 2014, I redesigned the website using WordPress, but had to scrap online registration.
