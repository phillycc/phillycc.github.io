This Agile project represented a UI redesign of Switzerlandâ€™s national real estate website, plus introduced several new functionalities.  I coded all user functionality and database integration. I also lead the team framing the site in Bootstrap per our graphic design specs. This approach was duplicated for the ERA Germany website.

### Coolest app features
Search box auto-suggestion, infinite scroll of property search results, and custom property photo scrollers/carousels with thumbnail previewers

### Biggest accomplishments
* Retro-fit much of the existing business logic (written in ColdFusion) and numerous SQL Server stored procecures 
* The site represented my first full-blown implementation of the Bootstrap framework and its various components

### Technologies used
* Bootstrap/HTML/CSS
* Javascript/jQuery
* Typeahead.js
* Ajax/JSON
* Google Maps
* SQL/SQL Server  
* ColdFusion
* Subversion

### Note
The website was redesigned in 2017
