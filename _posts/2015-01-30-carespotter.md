This project represented a website redesign for an Orlando healthcare start-up.  The redesigned website launched May 2015. Carespotter is an online marketplace for matching caregivers directly with with those in need of their services, thereby affording greater cost savings and control in the selection process.

### Coolest app features
Caregiver search involves more than just proximity look-ups via the Google Maps API. Users can also search based on caregiver therapeutic modalities, years of experience, level of education, hobbies, language, etc. Also, the site provides secure online payment, but only when each care task is complete and the end user is happy with the service. 

### Biggest accomplishments
* Working on a virtual team via Slack, I programmed 18 multi-step registration screens for new caregivers, plus added functionality for registered caregivers to manage their individual profiles. * This project included my first introduction to Ruby and object-relational mapping (ORM).
