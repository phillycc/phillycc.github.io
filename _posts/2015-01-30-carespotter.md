This project represented a website redesign2 for an Orlando healthcare start-up.  Working on a virtual team via Slack, I programmed 18 multi-step registration screens for new caregivers, plus functionality for registered caregivers to manage their profiles. The redesigned website launched May 2015.

### Special features:
* Responsive design
* Mobile best practices
* Secure payment functionality
* Location-based search
* Facebook authentication and login
