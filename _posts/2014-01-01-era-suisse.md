This project represented a redesign of Switzerlandâ€™s national real estate website.  I took the team lead in framing the site in Bootstrap 3 per our graphic design specs.  I also coded all user functionality and that included customizing javascript libraries and components and making Ajax calls to a SQL Server database.  Once launched, the site eliminated the need for the ERA Suisse mobile website.
