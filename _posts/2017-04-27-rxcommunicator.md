My primary role for this greenfield project was to design and document a native mobile app's UI/UX. The app (built by a third party company) provides doctors real-time tracking and notifications of their patients' prescriptions by way of a RESTful web API (built by BioPlus). I mocked up the app with Balsamiq, created a MuleSoft online developer portal to document the UI/UX integration with the API, and lead the planning efforts.

### Coolest app features
The app provides doctors total transparency as to how successful we are in meeting the BioPlus 2-Hour Patient Acceptance Guarantee. It also gives doctors and their nursing staff the ability to securely communicate with BioPlus staff via text in compliance with HIPAA laws.

### Biggest accomplishments
* Completing the entire project within a mandated deadline of 12 weeks
* Managed the evolving needs of numerous internal stakeholders as well as coordinated with a handful of native app developers located in Poland
* Ultimately created nearly 75 detailed and interactive wireframes

### Technologies used
* Balsamiq
* MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform
* Postman
* Visual Studio Team Services with git
