As an employee of ERA Europe, I created an app that strategically inserts a user's Facebook content into a promotional 2-minute real estate video. ERA Europe received an iNOVA Brand Management Honors award for its "We Already Know You" Facebook Video Campaign based in large part on the work that I did.

### Coolest app features
We shot the video on a movie set at Full Sail University. With Facebook Connect, the film (converted to a Flash SWF file) offered a customized experience to the end user by inserting their name, photos, and friends' profile pics at strategic moments during the movie. I also gave users the ability to post a message on their Facebook wall and send an email notification about the app to their friends. 

### Biggest accomplishments
* Mastering Facebook Graph API to retrieve user data, social login with Facebook, and leveraging ActionScript (inside a Flash file) to insert user data and photos at the appropriate keyframes.    

### Technologies used
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript/jQuery
* Ajax/JSON
* Flash with Actionscript 3.0
* Facebook Graph API
* SQL/SQL Server  
* ColdFusion
* Subversion

### NOTE
The app was decommissioned in 2015
