As an employee of ERA Europe, I created an app that strategically inserts a user's Facebook content into a promotional 2-minute real estate video. ERA Europe received an iNOVA Brand Management Honors award for its "We Already Know You" Facebook Video Campaign based in large part on the work that I did.
