As an employee of ERA Europe, I created an app that strategically inserts a user's Facebook account data and photos into a promotional 2-minute real estate video. ERA Europe received an iNOVA Brand Management Honors award for its "We Already Know You" Facebook Video Campaign.

### Special features
* Login in with Facebook
* Inserts user's name, photos, and friends' profile pics
* Posts a message to the user's Facebook wall
* Option to send email about the app to friends
* Logs and stores user stats in database
* Cheesy 1970s-style music at the end

![ERA Europe Facebook Web App]({{ "/images/" | append: page.img_large | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url  }})

### Technologies:
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript/jQuery
* Ajax/JSON
* Flash with Actionscript 3.0
* Facebook Graph API
* SQL/SQL Server  
* ColdFusion

Disclaimer: The app does not incorporate the latest Facebook Graph API changes and subsequently may not function as designed.
